101;0;Come back when JT can have a performance like Bruno's runaway baby that he did on the Grammys 2011 or like his Amy Winehouse tribute singing valerie. JT's performing skills are basic and like any other POP/R&B act whereas bruno is 100% a showman and goes back to a time when singing live perfectly and dancing at the same time mattered. And JB has zero talent and he will never have. Bruno is doing the Super Bowl next year & people will be pleasantly surprised when they see him.;1;0.6963036166760727

1304;0;random comment soon to be lost to the endless wall of text as my wife holding our 5 day old and I discuss Chrissy Teigen when I pull up this song to see that it received 2.2 billion views on 4/2/23 at 11:18pm having never fully heard this song and thinking to myself that the lyrics really do apply perfectly to my wonderful, beautiful, and completely appreciated wife whom I love dearly.;1;0.9327553025826

1308;0;1:08 did his voice glitched or maybe it's from the mixing table?;0;0.297104144501733
1309;0;This song is so sappy its like taking a pint container of strawberry flavored syrup and drinking the whole thing straight.  I mean it opens with a nice Philip Glass chordal progression (let's be real, this is totally ripped from Glass), but at around 0:44 it wanders off into candied ballad land.  Nauseating.;1;0.5079591833473476
1310;0;after hearing it for the 100th time I just realised that someone is singing in the background form 2:30 to 3:50 and that someone sounds like harry maybe? What do you guys think?;0;0.3989723682110296
