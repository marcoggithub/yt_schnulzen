I love singing so much and it’s the only thing I love to do.
My dream is to make it as a singer and share my music with the world. That’s all I want in life.

I like all genres and respect all artists. So far I have posted a few covers on my channel with much more to come.

It would mean the world if you could just give this comment a thumbs up and bring me one step closer to a miracle. And please help me reach 1000 subscribers. It would mean more than anything

Thank you!

4626,"HEY YOU 
 Yes you. stop being unhappy with yourself. You're perfect. Stop wishing you looked like someone else or wishing people liked you as much as they like someone else. stop trying to get attention from those who hurt you. Stop hating your body, your face, your personality, your quirks. Love them. Without those things you wouldn't be you. And why would you want to be someone else? Be confident with who you are. Smile. It'll draw people in. If anyone hates on you because you are happy with yourself then stick your middle finger up in the air and say screw it. Your happiness should not depend on others anymore.

What's the dance though?
Ed's rocking standard ballroom gears, waistcoat and all...
But Brittany seems to be wearing something more latin-y.
The song has the 2-3-4-1 rumba count,
but at times the flicks and twists are totally argentine tango,
and Brittany isn't wearing latin heels...
Then again the turns at 3:17 look kind of influenced by viennese.
But I swear this looks more acrobatic contemporary than anything else.
