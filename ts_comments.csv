Yeah, there are similarities, esp. the crescendo at 2:59 with the vocal melody exactly the same as Marvin, but I'd put it down to 'influence' rather than plagiarism. I think there's enough that is distinctly Ed, rather than Marvin. Wow, it's a good song tho and that girl is fantastic. She makes it look like Ed can dance. I'd like to hear Ed sing Let's get it on, but I don't think that would have done his case much good.",Ed_Sheeran-Thinking_Out_Loud,1,,en,['2:59']
2647,tonygunz21,"The first time I heard this song, my thoughts were that it sounded just like Let's get it on.  Same drum pattern (at the same tempo), groove, and chord progression.  You can love Ed Sheeran as much as you like, and I think this is a great song, but it blatantly borrowed all of those elements from Marvin Gaye's song.  There's nothing wrong with doing that, so long as you get the appropriate clearance from copying someone else's intellectual property.  To say this isn't is wild.  If you can't hear that you're either deaf or have no concept of music and music theory.  But hey, don't take my word for it.

If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: ""God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life"" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptized. Visit NeedGod.com and LivingWaters.com",Ed_Sheeran-Thinking_Out_Loud,1,,en,"['5:28', '3:16']"

♪ As pessoas se apaixonam de maneiras misteriosas
Talvez seja parte de um plano
Talvez apenas o toque de uma mão
Eu, me apaixono por você a cada dia
♫ com seus braços de amor
♫ sob a luz de mil estrelas
♫ sua cabeça sobre meu coração...
Seu sorriso estará sempre em minha mente e memória... ♪
Fala de entrega, de amar além das aparências mundanas, de assumir riscos, de se importar com alguém, no sentido de que tudo é importante.

Лично мне да, так что если найдется кто-то кому тоже это показалось знакомым и кто знает на что именно, можете написать название этой песни? Я не могу успокоится пока не найду ее. Кстати, возможно это тоже песня этого исполнителя.
(This comment in English using Google Translate because I need more people to understand what I just texted😩)
0:58 to me alone does this part sound very much like Ed Sheeran will start pulling out a word like misteriou-ou-ou-ous? Personally, yes, so if there is someone to whom it also seemed familiar and who knows what exactly, can you write the name of this song? I can’t calm down until I find it. By the way, maybe this is also the song of this artist.",Ed_Sheeran-Thinking_Out_Loud,1,,en,"['0:58', '0:58']"

I desire that the Feast of Mercy be a refuge and shelter for all souls, and especially for poor sinners. On that day, the very depths of My tender mercy are open. I pour out a whole ocean of graces upon those souls who approach the fount of My mercy. The soul that will go to Confession and receive Holy Communion shall obtain the complete forgiveness of sins and punishment. On that day all the divine floodgates through which grace flow are opened. Let no soul fear to draw near to Me, even though its sins be as scarlet.

Jesus, I trust In You!

What's the dance though?
Ed's rocking standard ballroom gears, waistcoat and all...
But Brittany seems to be wearing something more latin-y.
The song has the 2-3-4-1 rumba count,
but at times the flicks and twists are totally argentine tango,
and Brittany isn't wearing latin heels...
Then again the turns at 3:17 look kind of influenced by viennese.
But I swear this looks more acrobatic contemporary than anything else.

Tapi sy pernah denger Sia dan Rihanna kaya gini juga terutama pas live singing.

Kalopun ini ini slipped atau crack vokal yang belum keedit ketika editing/mixing, wajar sih karena suaranya hangat halus tapi tidak mengganggu alur vokal utama.

Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now.

Our song on the radio but it don’t sound the same.

When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down.

Cause my heart breaks a little, when I hear your name.

0:49
It all just sounds like- 

Oooh

Mmm

Too young, too dumb to realize-

1:02
That I should’ve bought you flowers,
and held your hand.

Should’ve gave you all my hours,
when I had the chance.

Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance.

Now my baby’s dancin’
But she’s dancin’ with another man.

1:34
My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways,

caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life.

Now I never,

never get to clean up the mess I made,

Oh

and that haunts me every time I clooose my eyes.

""Em 1 Mês Ou semanas""

Por causa da Camisa Conheci uma pessoa, Falei com ela, e me apaixonei, por uma pessoa que nunca encontrei, em 2 dias eu a conquistei, conversei Muito... Com ela, não conheci muito bem a minha bela, No 4 dia Nos estávamos namorando, não a beijei, mas eu gostei, acordei as 6:30 só pra ver ela, me apaixonei, pela aquele rosto me encantei, chamava ela de Princesa, e ela de meu Príncipe, mas quando ela me beijou, Nenhum encanto me formou, Hem 2 semanas ela me traiu, fiquei triste, e Chorei, por aquela menina que eu nunca pensei, pensei que ela me amava de verdade, as palavras que ela falava era tão linda, que iludia a minha cabeça, enganou o meu coração, ela jogou ele No chão, 1 dia depois a perdoei, e o pior Foi que eu voltei, para os braços da quela menina, eu mesmo me enganei, o namoro não era o mesmo, sentia ela longe de mim, Longe do meu coração, percebi que não era mais uma Paixão, e acabei, com a menina que eu sempre Amei.

Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that person is worse than 
the first. So also will it be with this evil generation.

If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: ""God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life"" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9).

Starts at 0:17


What would I do without your big mouth/
Sucking my balls, then spitting them out/
You've got my head spinning, Charlie Sheen winning, booty so round/
Give no fucks about that beautiful mind/
Told you i'm not a player, I lied/
And I'm so dizzy, this weed hit me, but I'll be alright/

Got head from your daughter/
Dat bitch was so fine/
I'm crazy and I'm out of my mind/

Cause all of me/
Fucked all of you/
Love your curves and all your booty/
Even when i'm feelin moody/
Twerk dat ass for meee/
I'll give these $1's to youuu/
You're my bitch and my beginning/
Never lost I'm always winning/
'Cause I give you allllllll of D/
And you give me allllllll of you/",John_Legend-All_of_Me,1,,en,['0:17']

I updated every single status with _I kissed a girl and I liked it, the taste of her cherry chapstick. I kissed a girl and I liked it, hope my GF don't mind it.... __#irony_ when I came across a playlist and watched some of it. I was listening to Adele on the playlist by now and was reading the YouTube comments (as usual) when somebody decided to comment, ""WHO'S WATCHING THIS AFTER ""HELLO"" and _of course_ I *had* to go over and listen to ""Hello"" when I got bored and came to _this_ video.

I'm here because today
my bestfriend committed suicide 
We live in the same apartment shared a room
This morning I found him hanging

Its 10:47pm
I miss him alot
His parents took away the body to put in coffin 
He is Cristian btw
The cause of his did was for his break up 
Just if he told us sooner that his girlfriend is cheating on him
I feel lonely 
We were living in that apartment for 2 year 
And been friends since 2016
I miss him
Cant sleep 
Cant be awake 
When I go to sleep seen from morning comes forward me
When I'm awake i only think of him
So I came here to lite my sorrows
